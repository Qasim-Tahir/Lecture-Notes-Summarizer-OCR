OPENING PROFILE
SUPERJAM
The Classic Entrepreneurial Story

* Web: http://www.superjam.co.uk • Facebook: SuperJam 100% Fruit Spread • SuperJam's Recipe App

Growing up in Scotland, Fraser Doherty spent his childhood coming up with ideas for new products. Not all his money-making ideas were a success—indeed, his fledgling egg-selling enterprise ended abruptly when a fox ate all his chickens—but he had a hunger to set up a business.

At the age of 14, Doherty gave jam-making a try. He had always enjoyed the jam his grandmother made and thought there might be an opportunity here. After making a batch and selling it door-to-door, he discovered people really liked it, and Doherty's jam enterprise gradually spread into local shops and farmers' markets. A feature in the Edinburgh Evening News brought in even more orders from further afield.

After resolving to expand the business, Doherty did some research and found that sales of jam had been in decline for the past few decades. Jam had acquired an old-fashioned image and people preferred healthier alternatives on their toast.

The solution the young Scottish entrepreneur came up with was a jam for the modern world. Doherty's SuperJam would be made using traditional recipes, completely from fruit juice. The jars would contain no sugar and no artificial flavoring. He also boldly resolved to target supermarkets to sell his products.

Fraser faced a number of challenges. At this point, he was making hundreds of jars of jam every week in his parents' kitchen. Apart from the fact his parents were struggling to get in there to cook their dinner, the business clearly couldn't grow any further.

At the age of 17, he was in no position to start a factory and did not have any money to pay a design agency to create a brand. He did not have a clue about how to approach supermarkets either. All he had was a passion about his product and a great recipe.

The first supermarket Fraser approached was Waitrose on a “meet the buyer” day. Fraser pitched his idea to the senior jam buyer—he liked it but said it had a long way to go. He advised Fraser to set up a production facility and create a brand before coming back with a well-priced product.

Fraser set off around the United Kingdom trying to convince food manufacturers to believe in his 100 percent fruit jam. He told them that he didn't have any money to invest, but if they took the long-term view, then they too would reap the benefit. He did the same with a string of advertising agencies to persuade them to help him create a brand. Eventually, after two years of persistence, Doherty finally convinced a factory and an advertising agency to work with him.

SuperJam is exhibited in the National Museum of Scotland as an “Iconic Scottish Brand” alongside Irn-Bru and Tunnock's and Baxters, two other brands synonymous with Scotland. In 2010, Fraser shared his jam-making secrets with the world in the SuperJam Cook; this was followed in 2011 by his autobiography and jam story, SuperBusiness. Since 2010, Fraser has been the entrepreneur-in-residence at the London Metropolitan University, where he delivers presentations and lectures on aspects of entrepreneurship.

Doherty has kept close to his customers throughout SuperJam's meteoric rise and is conscious of the part technology and, in particular, social networks play in his business and in maintaining a meaningful conversation with his customers.

Against a backdrop of digital social networking, SuperJam Tea Parties are about as far removed from the virtual world as you could imagine. The company runs these events for elderly people who live alone, primarily in care homes or sheltered accommodation. To date, they have run over 350 events across the United Kingdom. The mix of live music, dancing, a heavy dose of scones, and SuperJam attract up to 600 people to each event.

From humble beginnings working at his kitchen table to growing his entrepreneurial venture, Fraser now supplies over 2,000 supermarkets around the world with SuperJam and has won a variety of awards for the range. Fraser has now scooped up over 20 prestigious awards, including Bighearted Scotland Business Person of The Year (2009), Smarta 100 Award (2010), and Inc. magazine's 30 under 30 Award (2010). He also made the finals for “Times Young Power List” (2011), NatWest Enterprise Awards Finalist (2012), and Ben & Jerry's “Join Our Core” Finalist (2012).

Introduction to Entrepreneurship

There is tremendous interest in entrepreneurship around the world. Although this statement may seem bold, there is evidence supporting it, some of which is provided by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). GEM, which is a joint research effort among several international universities and the International Council for Small Business, tracks entrepreneurship in 112 countries, including the United States. Of particular interest to GEM is total early stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA), which consists of businesses that are just being started and businesses that have been in existence for less than three and a half years. A sample of the rate of total early-stage entrepreneurial activity in countries included in the GEM study is shown in Table 1.1. Although the high rates of entrepreneurial start-up activities occur in low-income countries, where good jobs are not plentiful, the rates are also impressive in high-income countries such as Germany (4.7 percent), United Kingdom (6.9 percent), and the United States (11.9 percent). What the 11.9 percent means for the United States is that almost 1 out of every 8 1/2 American adults is actively engaged in starting a business or is the owner/manager of a business that is less than three-and-a-half-years old.

The GEM study also identifies whether its respondents are starting a new business to take advantage of an attractive opportunity or because of necessity. The majority of people across the countries the GEM study follows are drawn to entrepreneurship to take advantage of attractive opportunities, rather than starting out of necessity. In fact, in countries with a strong inclination for innovation like Germany and the United States, the number of people who start businesses to pursue an opportunity outnumber the people who are starting a business out of necessity 3.4 to 1.0.

One criticism of entrepreneurship, which is often repeated in the press, is that the majority of new businesses fail. It simply isn't true. The often used statistic that 9 out of 10 businesses fail in their first few years is an exaggeration.

In the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over half the businesses started are still in existence five years later. The number drops to just over a third after 10 years, but some of the businesses disappeared because they were successful and were sold or were acquired by another firm. While overall these figures are heartening, the percentage of firms that do fail shows that a motivation to start and run a business isn't enough; indeed, motivation must be coupled with a solid business idea, good financial management, and effective execution to maximize chances for success. In this book, we'll discuss many examples of entrepreneurial firms and the factors separating successful new ventures from unsuccessful ones.

Many people see entrepreneurship as an attractive career path. Think about your friends and others you know. In all probability, you are acquainted with at least one or two people who want to become an entrepreneur—either now or at some point in the future. The number of books dealing with starting one's own business is another indication that entrepreneurship is growing in popularity. Amazon.com, for example, currently lists over 58,510 books dealing with entrepreneurship and over 80,686 books concerned with small businesses. The number of books on entrepreneurship is up from 36,900 just three years ago.

## What Is Entrepreneurship and Why Is It Important?

The word entrepreneur derives from the French words entre, meaning "between," and prendre, meaning "to take." The word was originally used to describe people who "take on the risk" between buyers and sellers or who "undertake" a task such as starting a new venture. Inventors and entrepreneurs differ from each other. An inventor creates something new. An entrepreneur assembles and then integrates all the resources needed—the money, the people, the business model, the strategy, and the risk-bearing ability—to transform the invention into a viable business.

Entrepreneurship is defined as the process by which individuals pursue opportunities without regard to resources they currently control for the purpose of exploiting future goods and services. Others define entrepreneurship as the art of turning an idea into a business. In essence, an entrepreneur's behavior finds him or her trying to identify opportunities and putting useful ideas into practice. The tasks called for by this behavior can be accomplished by either an individual or a group and typically require creativity, drive, and a willingness to take risks. Kirsten Blowers, the subject entrepreneur in the chapter's "Opening Profile," exemplifies all these qualities. Kirsten saw an opportunity to create a new type of women's clothing boutique and online store and a new type of shopping experience for the women in her target market. She risked her career by passing up alternatives to work on Riffraff full time, and she's now working hard to put Riffraff in a position to deliver creative and useful products to its customers.

In this book, we focus on entrepreneurship in the context of an entrepreneur or team of entrepreneurs launching a new business. However, ongoing firms can also behave entrepreneurially. Typically, established firms with an entrepreneurial emphasis are proactive, innovative, and risk-taking. For example, Google is widely recognized as a firm in which entrepreneurial behaviors are clearly evident. Larry Page, one of Google's cofounders, is at the heart of Google's entrepreneurial culture. With his ability to persuade and motivate others' imaginations, Page continues to inspire Google's employees as they develop innovative product after innovative product. To consider the penetration Google has

## Why Do People Become Entrepreneurs?

The three primary reasons that people become entrepreneurs and start their own firms are to be their own boss, pursue their own ideas, and pursue financial rewards.

## Step 4: Extract text from page 33 (continued)

## Be Their Own Boss

The first of these reasons—being one's own boss—is given most commonly. This doesn't mean, however, that entrepreneurs are difficult to work with or that they have trouble accepting authority. Instead, many entrepreneurs want to be their own boss because either they have had a long-time ambition to own their own firm or because they have become frustrated working in traditional jobs. The type of frustration that some entrepreneurs feel working in conventional jobs is exemplified by Wendy DeFeudis, the founder of VeryWendy, a company that makes customized social invitations. Commenting on how her experiences working

with some of its innovations, think of how often you and people you know use the Google search engine, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Earth, or Google Home. Google is currently working on a bevy of far-reaching innovations, such as a virtual reality platform for Android and self-driving cars. Similarly, if you were to study Facebook's or Dropbox's actions you would quickly recognize their ability to grow and succeed. This growth and success reveals a history of entrepreneurial behavior at multiple levels within the two firms. In addition, many of the firms traded on the NASDAQ (the largest U.S. stock market with nearly 3,100 companies listed), such as Apple, Zynga, Facebook, and Amgen are commonly thought of as entrepreneurial firms.

As we mentioned, existing firms too can act entrepreneurially. In this sense, established firms with an orientation toward acting entrepreneurially practice **corporate entrepreneurship**. All firms fall along a conceptual continuum that ranges from highly conservative to highly entrepreneurial. The position of a firm on this continuum is referred to as its **entrepreneurial intensity**. As we noted, entrepreneurial firms are typically proactive innovators and are not averse to taking calculated risks. In contrast, conservative firms take more of a "wait and see" posture, are less innovative, and are risk averse.

One of the most persuasive indications of entrepreneurship's importance to an individual or a firm is the degree of effort undertaken to behave entrepreneurially. Firms with higher entrepreneurial intensity regularly look for ways to cut bureaucracy. For example, Virgin Group, the large British conglomerate, works hard to keep its units small and instill in them an entrepreneurial spirit. Virgin is one of the most recognized brands in Britain and is involved in businesses as diverse as airlines and music. In the following quote, Sir Richard Branson, the founder and CEO of Virgin, describes how his company operates in an entrepreneurial manner:

Convention . . . dictates that "big is beautiful," but every time one of our ventures gets too big we divide it up into smaller units. I go to the deputy managing director, and the deputy marketing director and say, "Congratulations. You're now MD [managing director], managing director], sales director and marketing director—of a new company." Each time we've done this, the people involved haven't had much more work to do, but necessarily they have a greater incentive to perform and a greater zeal for their work. The results for us have been terrific. By the time we sold Virgin Music, we had as many as 50 subsidiary record companies, and not one of them had more than 60 employees.

## Pursue Their Own Ideas

The second reason people start their own firms is to pursue their own ideas. The three young entrepreneurs are starting a graphic design business. They are passionate about website design, logo design, and business branding.

An entrepreneurial career is full of possibilities.

These three young entrepreneurs are starting a graphic design business. They are passionate about website design, logo design, and business branding.

working for herself have been more satisfying than working for a large firm, DeFeudis remarked:

I always wanted to be my own boss. I felt confined by the corporate structure. I found it frustrating and a complete waste of time—a waste to have to sell my ideas to multiple people and attend all kinds of internal meetings before moving forward with a concept.

Some entrepreneurs transition from a traditional job to owning their own business more gradually, as shown by a decision to initially operate their firm on a part-time basis. While this approach isn't possible in all situations, by starting money they earn, and find out if they really like the business before deciding to leave their job. In some businesses, such as catering or financial planning, it takes time to build a client list. Some entrepreneurs will time their departure from their job with the point in time at which their client list is large enough and profitable enough to support a full-time business.

The second reason people start their own firms is to pursue their own ideas. Some people are naturally alert, and when they recognize ideas for new products or services, they have a desire to see those ideas realized. Corporate entrepreneurs who innovate within the context of an existing firm typically have a mechanism for their ideas to become known. Established firms, however, often resist innovation. When this happens, employees are left with good ideas that go unfulfilled. Because of their passion and commitment, some employees choose to leave the firm employing them in order to start their own business as means to develop their own ideas.

This chain of events can take place in noncorporate settings, too. For example, some people, through a hobby, leisure activity, or just everyday life, recognize the need for a product or service that is not available in the marketplace. If the idea is viable enough to support a business, they commit tremendous time

--- Pages 36 to 38 ---

**CHAPTER 1 | INTRODUCTION TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP 35**

and energy to converting the idea into a part-time or full-time firm. In Chapters 2 and 3, we focus on how entrepreneurs spot ideas and determine if their ideas represent viable business opportunities.

Many entrepreneurs experience tremendous satisfaction when their entrepreneurial idea catches on, and they see the positive results it creates. An example is Marco Zappacosta, the founder of Thumbtack. Thumbtack is an online platform that allows people to quickly locate local service providers, such as photographers, house painters, and piano teachers. Zappacosta's insight at the time Thumbtack was founded in 2009 was that all across America there were local service providers struggling to find new clients, and ordinary people looking for service providers they could trust. Commenting on how Thumbtack solves both a big problem but also makes a difference in ordinary people's lives, Zappacosta remarked:

The macro of it (connecting people who need services with people who are willing to provide them) is a big problem and it's satisfying to work on big things that can have a huge impact. But then what (I) really like—you feel day to day—is the stories of impacting individuals, it's the pest control guy in Brooklyn sending us flowers to say thank you for all the business that we're now sending him, or the busy mom who is sending pictures of her birthday party that she was able to throw with Thumbtack. That feels great and that's certainly a bigger part of the motivation that we feel.

Since its inception, Thumbtack has helped millions of people connect with local service providers and over $1 billion is exchanged through its platform each year.

## Pursue Financial Rewards

Finally, people start their own firms to pursue financial rewards. This motivation, however, is typically secondary to the first two and often fails to live up to its hype. The average entrepreneur does not make more money than someone with a similar amount of responsibility in a traditional job. The financial lure of entrepreneurship is its upside potential. People such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google made billions of dollars building their firms. Money is also a unifier. Making a profit and increasing the value of a company is a solidifying goal that people can rally around. But money is rarely the primary motivation behind the launch of an entrepreneurial firm. Some entrepreneurs even report that the financial rewards associated with entrepreneurship can be bittersweet if they are accompanied by losing control of their firm. For example, Sir Richard Branson, after selling Virgin Records, wrote, "I remember walking down the street [after the sale was completed]. I was crying. Tears . . . [were] streaming down my face. And there I was holding a check for a billion dollars . . . . If you'd have seen me, you would have thought I was loony. A billion dollars." For Branson, it wasn't just the money—it was the thrill of building the business and of seeing the success of his initial idea.

## Characteristics of Successful Entrepreneurs

Although many behaviors have been ascribed to entrepreneurs, several are common to the successful ones. Those in new ventures and those who are already part of an entrepreneurial firm share these qualities, which are shown in Figure 1.1 and described in the following section.

**LEARNING OBJECTIVE**

## Passion for the Business

The number one characteristic shared by successful entrepreneurs is a passion 

for their business, whether it is in the context of a new firm or an existing 

business. Frequently, it's the passion for an idea that gets a business going and 

keeps it going when times are tough. This sentiment was expressed by Patrick 

Whaley, the founder of Titin, a company that makes innovative weighted com-

pression gear, which some athletes have found useful in training. "I'm passion-

ate that there's a better way to train," Whaley said. "That's what inspired me to 

design and develop this product, and that's what keeps me going." 

Recall that Kirsten Blowers, the owner of Rifffraff and the subject company of the chapter's 

"Opening Profile" remains "passionate about her business" and that this passion 

influences her daily as she leads her businesses.

Making a difference in people's lives is the primary motivator behind many 
social enterprises, which are often started by people who set aside promising 
careers to pursue a social goal. This was the case with John Wood, who founded 
Room to Read and is the author of the book Leaving Microsoft to Change the 
World. Wood's deep passion in small amounts of Microsoft stock to buy books 
and build schools, even before he left the company. In excerpts from an interview 
published by Forbes magazine, Wood said:

During my travels, I met so many children in the poorest parts of the world, lacking 
access to school, books, and libraries, that I began cashing in small amounts of 
access to school, books, and libraries, that I began cashing in small amounts of 
stocks to help them. Two hundred shares of Microsoft stock was enough to build 
an entire school in rural Nepal.

Wood eventually left Microsoft to work on Room to Read full time. Since its 
inception in 2000, Room to Read has served over 10.7 million children, pub-
lished 1,295 books, and delivered over 18 million books to young readers, all in 
developing parts of the world.

Passion is particularly important for both for-profit and not-for-profit entre-
preneurial organizations because although rewarding, the process of starting 
a firm or building either a profit-making corporation or a social enterprise is 
demanding. There are five primary reasons passion is important, as reflected 
in Table 1.2. Each of these reasons reflects a personal attribute that passion 
engenders. Removing just one of these qualities would make it much more dif-
ficult to launch and sustain a successful entrepreneurial organization.

A note of caution is in order here: While entrepreneurs should have pas-
sion, they should not wear rose-colored glasses. It would be a mistake to 
believe that all one needs is passion and anything is possible. It is important 
to be enthusiastic about a business idea, but it is also important to understand 
its potential flaws and risks. In addition, entrepreneurs should understand 
that all one needs is passion and anything is possible. It is important 
to be enthusiastic about a business idea, but it is also important to understand 
its potential flaws and risks. In addition, entrepreneurs should understand 

## TABLE 1.2 Five Primary Reasons Passion Is Important for the Launch of a Successful 
Entrepreneurial Organization

## Reason Passion Is Important 

## Explanation

1. The ability to learn and iterate 
Founders don't have all the answers. It takes passion and drive to solicit feedback, 
make necessary changes, and move forward. Needed changes won't always be 
obvious. Passion makes the search for the right answers invigorating and fun.

2. A willingness to work hard for an 
extended period of time 
Commonly, entrepreneurs work longer hours than people with traditional jobs. You 
can only do that on a sustained basis if you're passionate about what you're doing.

3. Ability to overcome setbacks 
and "no's" 
It's rare that an entrepreneur doesn't experience setbacks and hear many "no's" 
from potential customers, investors, and others while building an entrepreneurial 
business on a sustained basis if you're passionate about what you're doing. 
You can only do that 
potential customers, investors, and others while building an entrepreneurial 
business without one—who will tell you how to improve your organization and how to 
improve yourself. You have to be willing to listen to the people with good intentions 
and make 
changes if it helps. But you also have to be able to brush aside feedback from people 
with bad intentions without letting them get you down.

4. Perseverance and persistence 
come from passion 
As an entrepreneur, you'll have 
down days. Building an entrepreneurial organization is fraught with challenges. 
Passion is what provides an entrepreneur the motivation to get through tough times.

that the most effective business ideas take hold when their passion is consistent with their skills and is in an area that represents a legitimate business opportunity.

To illustrate the importance of passion, as well as other factors that are critical in determining a firm's success or failure, we include a boxed feature titled "What Went Wrong?" in each chapter. The feature for this chapter shows how Prim, a laundry and pick-up and delivery service, ultimately failed, in part because its founders were not able to remain passionate about their business idea.

## Step 2: Continue extracting text from the first image
### Product/Customer Focus

A second defining characteristic of successful entrepreneurs is a **product/customer focus**. This quality is exemplified by Steven Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple Inc., who wrote, "The computer is the most remarkable tool we've ever built . . . but the most important thing is to get them in the hands of as many people as possible."24 This sentiment underscores an understanding of the two most important elements in any business—products and customers. While it's important to think about management, marketing, finance, and the like, none of those functions makes any difference if a firm does not have good products with the capability to satisfy customers.

This philosophy is affirmed by Alex Algard, the founder of WhitePages.com. WhitePages.com started in 1997 to provide consumers a free, accurate, and fast online alternative to telephone directory assistance. It is one of the most trusted and comprehensive sources for consumers to quickly find relevant, accurate contact information in North America. When asked how he was able to grow WhitePages.com from a one-person operation in 1997 to the multimillion-dollar company it is today, Algard's reply reflected not only his feelings about the importance of providing value to both users and customers but also how a company measures if the value is being successfully delivered:

The philosophy that we as a company have always stuck to is that everything we build has to provide real value to both our users and customers. The best measurement of whether or not we are successful at delivering something valuable is if our customers, advertisers in our case, are willing to pay.25

A product/customer focus also involves the diligence to spot product opportunities and to see them through to completion. The idea for the Apple Macintosh, for example, originated in the early 1980s when Steven Jobs and several other Apple employees took a tour of a Xerox research facility. They were astounded to see computers that displayed graphical icons and pull-down menus. The computers also allowed users to navigate desktops using a small, wheeled device called a mouse. Jobs decided to use these innovations to create the Macintosh, the first user-friendly computer. Throughout the two and a half years during which the Macintosh team developed this new product, it maintained an intense product/customer focus, creating a high-quality computer that is easy to learn, fun to use, and meets the needs of a wide audience of potential users.26 Apple's early history, and in particular its commitment to building high-quality products, has been portrayed in several movies, including _Pirates of the Silicon Valley_ (2005) and _JOBS_ (2013).

Additional examples of product/market focus are provided in an excellent weekly podcast produced by National Public Radio (NPR) called "How I Built This." Each episode provides an in-depth interview with the founder of a well-known firm, and provides a complete overview of how the firm was built and won customers. Guests have included Joe Gebbie, the cofounder of Airbnb; Angie Hicks, the founder of Angie's List; Jane Wurwand, the founder of Dermalogica; and Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia.27

## WHAT WENT WRONG?

### Prim: How a Lack of Passion and Resolve Can Kill a Business

$\small \begin{array}{l}\text{P}\\\text{rim's idea was to disrupt the laundry industry. A}\\\end{array}$ growing number of people in the United States are using laundry services to wash and fold their clothes. The problem with these services is that they are a hassle. In most instances customers have to bag their laundry, drop the bag or bags off at the laundry service, and then pick them up later. Many services have lines at the busiest times of the day, which result in drivers having to wait to drop off or pick up their laundry.

Prim launched in mid-2013, after passing through the prestigious Y Combinator business accelerator program earlier that year. Here's how Prim's laundry service worked. A customer bagged her/his laundry, and then went online to choose a pickup and delivery time. The price was $25 for the first bag and $15 for each additional bag. The bags would be picked up by a driver recruited by a third-party delivery service. (Rickshaw was the name of the delivery service in the city where Prim started.) Everything would be back, washed and folded, later that day or early the next day. No cash changed hands between the customer and the pickup or delivery drivers. Everything was paid for through Prim's website. Prim gained favorable press and early momentum. When it closed, it was handling 1,000 pounds of laundry a day from 40 clients and was growing. What went wrong?

Two things went wrong with Prim. First, once Prim got your clothes, it went from an innovative disruptor to an old-school company. It would take your clothes to a laundry service and utilize its wash and fold services. Prim negotiated volume discounts with several laundry services; but, the discounts were verbal, not written. What Prim didn't count on was the partnerships going sour. While the laundry services were initially receptive to working with Prim, they had their own delivery services and eventually saw Prim as siphoning off their customers and revenue. During its short history, Prim churned through three different laundry services.

The second thing that went wrong with Prim was a lack of passion and resolve on the part of its founders. Faced with the reality that working with local laundry services was a fragile business model, Prim's founders, Yin Yin Wu and Xuwen Cao, had a decision to make. Should they build or lease their own laundry service? This was a daunting prospect, given the hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to build and staff a high-volume laundry wash and fold facility. Even more daunting was the prospect that this step would need to be repeated

in each new market Prim entered. After two months of deliberation, Wu and Cao pulled the plug. While they estimated that by constructing their own laundry service they could build a profitable business in 5 to 10 years, with revenues of $10 million to $15 million, it was a direction they simply did not want to pursue. Both were computer science students in college and had no direct experience in the laundry business. In an article published by CNNMoney, Garry Tan, a partner with Y Combinator, reflecting on why Wu and Cao closed Prim, said, "They didn't want to actually have to wash the laundry—they wanted to be the connector."

## Questions for Critical Thinking

1. Why is passion such a critical part of entrepreneurial success? Prim's founders were apparently passionate about building a company but not passionate about the laundry business specifically. In what ways is this combination problematic?

2. How could Prim's cofounders have better anticipated that laundry services would eventually see Prim as siphoning off their own business and be reluctant to work with them?

3. Rather than employ its own drivers to pick up and deliver laundry for its customers, Prim relied on the use of third-party delivery services. In what ways do you think this approach could have limited Prim's growth in other markets?

4. San Francisco, the city in which Prim launched, has several innovative laundry services. These include LaundryLocker, where you drop your clothes in a public locker, Sfwash (https://sfwash.com), and Sudzee, which requires you pay by the pound (https://sudzee.com). Select the service that you think has the most potential and explain the rationale for your selection. Compare the service to Prim's approach.
